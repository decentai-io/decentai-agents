"""Where the browser may go.

A browser on the runtime host can reach whatever the host can: a
metadata service, a database on the private network, the platform
itself. So every navigation and every request the page makes is checked
against its address, and one to a loopback or private address is
refused. ``DECENTAI_WEB_ALLOW_LOOPBACK=1`` is the tests' escape — a
loopback site and nothing else — the same variable the web agents use.

BEHIND THE PLATFORM'S PROXY. Where the platform confines an agent, the
worker cannot look a name up or open a connection of its own: its one
way out is a proxy the platform runs, named in ``DECENTAI_PROXY``. The
browser is handed that proxy, and the proxy makes the check made here —
every address a name resolves to, then a connection to the address it
checked. So a name is left to it, and what is checked here is what can
be checked without asking anybody: the scheme, and an address written
as an address.
