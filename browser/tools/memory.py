"""What a run remembers, and how much of it the mind is shown.

Everything is kept: every action and how it went, every record, every
word the person said. What is *shown* at a step is budgeted — a share
of the step's prompt each — rather than counted: "the last eight
actions" forgot the first client of seven by the time of the third,
whatever the model could have read.

Three things make a long run one piece of work:

- **The account.** The newest actions are shown as they happened. The
  older ones are folded, every so many steps, into an account the mind
  writes itself: what is done, what was learned, what remains. Nothing
  is forgotten; it is said in fewer words.
- **The plan.** Each step of it has a state, so where the run stands is
  in front of the mind at every step.
- **Recall.** What is no longer shown can be asked for.

Wherever something is cut, the cut is said, with how to get the rest.
